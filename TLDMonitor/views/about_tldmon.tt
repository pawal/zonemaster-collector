   <h1>About TLDMonitor</h1>

   <p>TLDMonitor was written by <a
   href="mailto:pawal@blipp.com">Patrik Wallstr√∂m</a> as a tool for
   analysis of a large number of Zonemaster measurements. It became a
   web interface to ease the analysis, and to improve the logging of
   the Zonemaster output. It is now easy to <strong>cross
   reference</strong> information between domains, and to
   <strong>discover anomalies</strong> in domain delegations.</p>

   <p>As for now, TLDMonitor uses the <strong>default Zonemaster
   policy</strong>.  This policy is not perfect for a TLD zone. One
   thing it mandates is the use of an MX record for a zone, this
   should not be allowed for a TLD. The Zonemaster project is
   developing policies that suits other uses as well.</p>

   <p>The first tool to be written was zonemaster-collect. The purpose
   of collect is to run Zonemaster on a very large number of domains,
   and to collect the result in a MongoDB database, or as JSON files
   on file.</p>

   <p>In order to use the MongoDB data store, the user has to learn
   how to search the results directly in the database. To easy this, I
   wrote this tool, TLDMonitor. It is called that, because an easy way
   to demonstrate the tool is to show off Zonemaster measurements on
   all TLDs. The tlds.sh tool writes a textfile with all current
   TLDs.</p>

   <p>All code for TLDMonitor can be found on the Github page: <a
